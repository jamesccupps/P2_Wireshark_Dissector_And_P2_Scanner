"""Turn a P2 body into named fields, using the catalog in `p2_asdu.py`.

`p2_data.py` names an operation and decodes an enum. This walks the operation's
declared structure over the bytes and reports every field it contains, with its
offset, width and value. It is the piece that lets a reader do what PROTOCOL.md
10.9 says is possible for 444 of 455 operations.

    from p2_body import decode
    result = decode(0x0981, "rsp", body)
    for f in result.fields:
        print(f.path, f.type, f.offset, f.width, f.value)

Nothing here is generated: `p2_asdu.py` is the data and this is the reading of
it. The two are kept apart so regenerating the catalog cannot overwrite the
walker.

**The rules this implements, and where they come from.** Each is a place where
the obvious reading is wrong, which is why the walker is more than a loop over
field widths:

  * **A string is a TLV**, `tag | u16 BE length | bytes`, and the tag is 0 or 1
    (8.1). The length is two bytes -- one byte would refuse every string of 256
    or more, the band that carries message text and PPCL lines (8.4.3).
  * **A CHOICE selects an arm by tag, and the tag is not always the arm's
    position** (10.4.1, 10.4.3). Where the tag map is known it is used; where it
    is not, the positional reading is applied and the field is marked so the
    caller can see the difference.
  * **One type name can mean different layouts under different parents**
    (10.4.2). `real_addr_` is five different widths depending on which
    `Physical_address_*` encloses it, and 65 other names are parent-qualified.
    Resolution therefore needs the parent, and happens where the parent is known.
  * **An array's length is a preceding field**, named `nrOf...`, and there is no
    marker in the bytes -- read the count, then that many elements.
  * **A body may legitimately end early.** Running out of bytes exactly at a
    field boundary is truncation, not corruption, and is reported as such rather
    than raised.

`decode` never raises on bad input: it returns whatever it read plus an `error`,
because a partial decode of an unexpected body is more useful to a reader than
an exception, and because a malformed body is a normal thing to meet on a wire.
