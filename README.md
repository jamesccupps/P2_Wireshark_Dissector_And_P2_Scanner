# Siemens APOGEE P2 (Protocol II)

Tools and a technical reference for **P2 ("Protocol II")**, the Siemens APOGEE
building-automation protocol over TCP — for owner-operators working with their own legacy
equipment. This repository contains three things:

- **[`PROTOCOL.md`](PROTOCOL.md)** — a wire-level technical reference for the protocol.
- **`p2.lua`** — a Wireshark dissector that decodes P2 on the wire (passive).
- **`p2_gui.py` / `p2_scanner.py`** — a scanner that reads from panels (active; see the
  *P2 Scanner* and *Scope & ethics* sections below), with `firmware_registry.py` (shared
  panel build-tag cache) and `analyze_pcap.py` (offline opcode/error census over a capture).

The dissector is built and validated from wire captures; the opcode names are the
protocol's AP2 function-code vocabulary.

> **Unreleased — a correction.** The `u32` at frame offset 4 is a **header
> length**, not a message class. It is `13 + the total bytes of the four routing
> slots`, so it is a sum of node-name lengths and differs from site to site —
> **compute it; never choose it**. Releases up to v2.8.2 described it as a class
> taking six values in legacy/modern pairs chosen by a panel's firmware
> generation, and told you to fingerprint a panel to pick one. That model is
> withdrawn: `PROTOCOL.md` §6.2 has the field, §6.6 the withdrawal, §6.2.5 what
> survives. The dialect probe and its cache are gone from the scanner, and every
> connect is now the fast path.
>
> **v2.8.2 — the decode side.** A request may carry a **zero-length body** — 220
> in the corpus do, and it is how a parameterless operation is encoded: the `u16`
> opcode is the whole message. And the opcode's high byte is a **structural**
> family band, not a descriptive one: the supervisor's AP2 command factory
> switches on `opcode & 0xFF00`.
>> Earlier releases are in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

Click a P2 packet and get:

- **Frame header** — total length, header length (checked against the slots the
  frame actually carries, and flagged on a mismatch), sequence, direction
- **Routing slots** — the four NUL-terminated ASCII slots `[BLN, dst-node, BLN, src-node]`
- **Opcode** — the 2-byte AP2 function code, labelled against the full
  name set; an opcode that isn't a defined function code shows as `unknown_0x….`
- **Operand** (`p2.operand`) — many opcodes are one operation with a parameter
  encoded in the opcode rather than the body, so a run of consecutive codes is an
  enumeration: `0x0220`–`0x022C` is *point log* with thirteen filters,
  `0x0244`/`0x0245`/`0x024C`/`0x024D` is *point command* with four states,
  `UPL_DEL_x`/`UPL_ADDED_x`/`UPL_ALL_x` is one upload with three phases. Where
  the opcode is part of such a family the dissector names the operand —
  `point log - filter: value` — and appends it to the Info column. 55 families,
  146 opcodes; about a fifth of the request frames in a real capture carry one.
- **Per-opcode body** — wire-verified decoders for the common operations:
  - **COV value push** (`0x0274`) — point name, present value (`f32` BE), and the
    10-byte condition/priority block split into its named fields
    (priority, control status, out-of-service / failed / proof / disabled / commanded
    flags, alarm state, alarm priority)
  - **Node-name-table replication** (`0x4634`) — the roster digest: each node name
    plus its version (change generation)
  - **Identity / keepalive exchange** (`0x4640`, `EBLN_PING`) — node / site / BLN identity,
    on session-establish and on the ~10-second heartbeat
  - **Addressing-family requests** — point read/command (`0x0220`/`0x0240`/`0x0241`), COV
    enable/disable (`0x0271`/`0x0273`), trend and bulk upload: scope tag + command priority,
    name + suffix, and (for commands) the `f32` value
  - **Alarm reports** (`0x0508`) — point + descriptor, the value block, and the event
    timestamps
  - **Enhanced-alarm definitions** (`0x0983` responses) — point, mode point, units,
    set point, and the alarm-level table: offset, priority, category and message
    number per level
  - **Equipment scheduling** (`0x0987`/`0x0988`/`0x0989` responses) — the zone, the
    per-mode command table (which point is driven to what value in each mode), and
    the mode schedule with its effective-from/until dates and start time. Dates
    carry a weekday byte, and the dissector checks it against the date — a
    mismatch is reported rather than hidden
  - **Responses** — correlated to their request by sequence and decoded: the
    `CABINET_DISPLAY` firmware banner, value/read results, and the identity block
  - **Scope tag + command priority**, **error codes**, and a generic TLV / value walk
    for everything else
- **Expected-body schema** — for ~440 opcodes, a `[struct-derived]` note listing the
  fields the body is expected to contain (see *Schema notes* below)

## Install

1. **Help → About Wireshark → Folders → "Personal Lua Plugins"**
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Wireshark\plugins\`
   - Linux / macOS: `~/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins/`
2. Drop `p2.lua` into that folder
3. **Analyze → Reload Lua Plugins** (`Ctrl+Shift+L`) or restart Wireshark

The Protocol column shows `P2` on TCP/5033 and TCP/5034 traffic. You can also load it
ad hoc: `tshark -X lua_script:p2.lua -r capture.pcapng`.

**If it loads but nothing decodes**, check that the protocol is not disabled.
Wireshark remembers a disabled protocol across sessions, in
`%APPDATA%\Wireshark\disabled_protos` (`~/.config/wireshark/disabled_protos`),
and a disabled dissector still registers and is simply never called — so P2
traffic decodes as plain `tcp:data` with no error anywhere. Re-enable it under
**Analyze → Enabled Protocols**, remove the `p2` line from that file, or pass
`--enable-protocol p2` to tshark.

## Ports

- **TCP/5033** is the canonical, default P2 port — every field panel (and the
  supervisor) listens here for inbound P2.
- **TCP/5034** is, in some deployments, a second supervisor-side listener carrying the
  panel→supervisor push/announce (reverse) channel. It is optional and
  deployment-specific; the protocol on it is identical to 5033.
- **Two listeners on one host may not be the same service.** At one observed
  supervisor the canonical 5033 was already taken by another product, so the P2
  peer service was configured onto 5034. Panel-initiated sessions succeed on
  5034; on 5033 the connection is accepted, the request read, and the session
  closed with no reply — 984 times in 25 minutes, nine panels retrying every
  14 s. An open port is not a promise that the peer speaks P2.

The dissector binds both. For any other port, use **Analyze → Decode As…** to map it to
`P2`. Frame semantics derive from the frame's contents and direction, never from the TCP
port it arrived on.

## Coverage at a glance

- **Header length, not message class** — the `u32` at offset 4 is
  `13 + the total bytes of the four routing slots`, so its value is a sum of node-name
  lengths and differs from site to site. **Compute it; never choose it.** An earlier
  edition of this project read the six values it happens to take at one site as a set of
  message classes in legacy/modern pairs, and that model is withdrawn — see
  `PROTOCOL.md` §6.2, and §6.6 for the withdrawal. The traffic those values were
  attached to is real and is selected by **opcode**: the `EBLN_PING 0x4640` identity
  exchange, DB-change and replication records, and alarm prints.
- **Opcodes** — 638 AP2 function codes are named (the 630-value vendor enum plus
  eight panel-side codes), matching the `PROTOCOL.md` §9.5 catalog one-for-one —
  the catalog is generated from the same table the tools ship, so they cannot drift. The common operations are byte-decoded; the rest show their name +
  expected-body schema + a generic body walk. An opcode outside the catalog renders as
  `unknown_0x….`
- **Errors** — all seven wire-observed codes from `PROTOCOL.md` §7.2.2: `0x0003`
  not_found, `0x00AC` not_supported, `0x0E15` not_commandable, `0x0002` out_of_scope,
  `0x0E11` already_exists, plus `0x0E12` and `0x0009`, whose precise meanings are not yet
  established (Appendix D item 3).
- **Values** — big-endian `f32`; the COV condition/priority block decoded field by field.

## Correctness notes

- **The opcode is present only on request/push frames (direction `0x00`)**, and it sits
  at a *variable* offset (immediately after the four NUL-terminated routing slots). The
  dissector scans the four NULs rather than assuming a fixed offset — reading the
  post-slot bytes off a success/error response would fabricate phantom opcodes.
- **There is no multicast "presence beacon."** Earlier versions decoded UDP/10001 to
  `233.89.188.1` as a Siemens P2 beacon; that traffic is actually unrelated
  gateway/heartbeat multicast, not P2. The real, *optional* Ethernet-BLN availability
  multicast is `234.5.6.7:8` and is **disabled by default** — a peer-liveness heartbeat,
  not a discovery mechanism. The decoder has been removed to avoid false positives.
- Routing-slot ordering is destination-first within the request direction; the BLN-name
  slot is the membership/admission key.

## Schema notes

For opcodes whose request body is defined by the AP2 type system, the dissector shows
an **expected-body schema** — the field list the body *should* contain. This is a
struct-derived aid, **not** a guaranteed byte layout: P2's body encoding uses TLV
framing, scope tags, and field widths that are only fully pinned for the wire-verified
opcodes. As live captures confirm an opcode's exact layout, its schema note is upgraded
to a real, byte-level field decode (as already done for COV, the replication roster, and
the identity exchange). Treat un-upgraded schema fields as expectations, not decoded
bytes.

## Useful tshark one-liner

Heuristic to spot Siemens PXC field panels in a capture without decoding payloads — PXCs
(Nucleus NET RTOS) characteristically emit `TTL=64` with a small fixed TCP window:

```bash
tshark -r capture.pcapng -Y "tcp.flags.syn==1" \
    -T fields -e ip.src -e ip.ttl -e tcp.window_size_value | sort -u
```

What a supervisor is actually asking for, by operand:

```bash
tshark -r capture.pcapng -X lua_script:p2.lua -Y p2.operand \
    -T fields -e p2.opcode -e p2.operand | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

## Protocol specification

[`PROTOCOL.md`](PROTOCOL.md) is the wire-level reference behind both tools: transport and
framing, the encoding primitives, addressing, the function-code (opcode) catalog and body
structures, the point model, change-of-value and alarming, PPCL over the wire, and security
considerations — with every claim evidence-tagged (`[W]` wire-observed / `[S]`
struct-derived / `[D]` vendor-doc / `[I]` inferred / `[OPEN]`). Start with its **Summary**
for the one-screen overview.

## Decoding a body into named fields

`PROTOCOL.md` documents the body structure of 457 operations. Two modules make that
machine-readable, so a tool does not have to guess at a body's shape:

- **`p2_asdu.py`** — the structure catalog, generated and embedded: field order and type
  for 1,019 structures (3,525 fields), every pinned type width, the parent-qualified
  types whose layout depends on what encloses them, and the recovered CHOICE tag maps.
  Data only; do not hand-edit it.
- **`p2_body.py`** — the walker that reads it. Hand-written, and kept separate so
  regenerating the catalog cannot overwrite it.

```python
from p2_body import decode

r = decode(0x0981, "rsp", body)          # "req" for a request or push
print(r.struct, r.consumed, "of", r.length, r.error)
for f in r.fields:
    print(f.path, f.type, f.offset, f.width, f.value)
```

`decode` never raises: an unexpected body returns the fields it managed to read plus an
`error` saying where it stopped, because a partial decode is more useful than an
exception and a malformed body is a normal thing to meet on a wire. Where a CHOICE's tag
map is not known, the arm is selected positionally and the field is **marked as such** —
`PROTOCOL.md` §10.4.1 shows that reading is wrong for four CHOICEs, so a caller has to be
able to tell a known selection from a guessed one.

`analyze_pcap.py --decode` runs it over every request body in a capture and reports how
far the declared structures got; `--decode-dump=N` prints the first N bodies field by
field. Over a 3,983-request reference capture: 3,835 bodies fully consumed, 144 with
trailing bytes the structure does not account for, 4 with no declared structure, and no
failures.

## P2 Scanner (companion active tool)

Alongside the passive dissector, this repository includes an **active** P2 scanner — a
client that connects to panels and reads from them, for an owner-operator inventorying and
monitoring **their own** equipment. It is the opposite end of the spectrum from the
dissector: the dissector only *watches* traffic, the scanner *sends* requests.

**Files (no data files needed):**

- `p2_gui.py` — a single-file Tkinter GUI. Edit your site settings in-app (no `site.json`
  required), discover/scan panels, browse the node/device tree, read and walk points, dump
  PPCL programs, compare scans, and export results to CSV/JSON. (The passive COV/push
  listener is CLI-only — see `--listen-push` below.)
- `p2_scanner.py` — the scanner library/CLI. Self-contained: the FLN/TEC point catalog is
  embedded, so it runs as one file. (An external `tecpoints.json` is still honored if you
  drop one in, to update the catalog.)
- `firmware_registry.py` — a small shared helper (per-panel build-tag cache; the
  build tag identifies the platform and its string encoding, and selects nothing
  about framing).

**Run it:**

```bash
python p2_gui.py            # GUI — recommended; edit config, scan, view, export
python p2_scanner.py --help # CLI
```

Common invocations:

```bash
# Inventory one panel's points
python p2_scanner.py --node 192.0.2.10 --network MYBLN --read-all

# Passive listen for COV / alarm pushes, pinned to the automation VLAN
python p2_scanner.py --listen-push 300 --listen-bind 192.0.2.50 --format json

# Offline opcode / error census over an existing capture
python analyze_pcap.py capture.pcapng
```

### CLI reference

Requires Python 3.10+ and the standard library only (the GUI additionally needs
`tkinter`, which ships with most CPython builds; on Debian/Ubuntu install
`python3-tk`). No third-party packages.

The GUI imports the scanner at runtime, so keep the three `.py` files together. Site
configuration is edited in **File → Edit Site Config** and is applied immediately;
`site.json` is written only if you choose **Save Config**, and is otherwise optional.

## Scope & ethics

P2 has **no authentication and no encryption** — the only admission check is a matching
BLN name, which is visible in cleartext on every frame (it is an access label, not a
secret). That makes this tooling powerful and easy to misuse, so:

- **Use it only on networks and equipment you own or are explicitly authorized to test.**
  These tools are for owner-operators securing and maintaining their own legacy plant.
- **Read-only by default.** The scanner is built around reads, browse, and enumeration.
  It does **not** implement panel-destructive operations (cold/warm start, flash erase,
  node eviction) — and a conformant tool should refuse to, even behind a flag.
- **Active discovery leaves a footprint.** A correct-BLN handshake registers the scanner's
  identity as a permanent node-table entry on the panel (this is how P2 registration
  works). Prefer the passive push-listener and the dissector when you only need to observe.
- **Rate-limit and avoid production disruption.** Use inter-request delays, a single
  connection per panel, and do not run scans against life-safety or revenue-critical
  systems outside a maintenance window. The replication-class opcodes can stall a panel.
- **Never expose P2 to an untrusted network.** Segment it onto a dedicated, firewalled
  automation VLAN.

This split — a passive dissector plus a read-oriented scanner, with destructive operations
documented but not shipped runnable — is deliberate: it helps a defender understand and
secure their own system without handing an attacker a turnkey weapon.
