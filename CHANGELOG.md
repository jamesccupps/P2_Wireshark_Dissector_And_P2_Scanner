# Changelog

## Unreleased — correction

**The "message class" model is withdrawn.** Earlier entries in this file, and
releases up to 2.8.2, described the `u32` at frame offset 4 as a message class
taking six values in legacy/modern pairs chosen by a panel's firmware
generation, and recommended fingerprinting a panel with `CABINET_DISPLAY`
(`0x010C`) to pick the right one.

That is wrong. **The field is a header length** — `13 + the total bytes of the
four NUL-terminated routing slots` — so it is a sum of node-name lengths and
differs from site to site. The six values are simply what one site's names
summed to. **Compute it; never choose it.** A wrong value is dropped silently by
the panel, which is why guessing appeared to work.

Consequences already in the tree: the dialect probe, its per-host cache and the
build-tag fast path are removed from the scanner; `p2.lua` shows the computed
length beside the wire value and flags a mismatch; `firmware_registry.py` keeps
only the platform/string-encoding role of the build tag. Those earlier entries
are left as written, since a changelog is a record of what was believed at the
time.

Full account in `PROTOCOL.md` §6.2, with §6.6 recording the withdrawal and
§6.2.5 listing which observations from the old model survive.

Release notes for the P2 dissector, scanner and protocol reference.
The current release is summarised at the top of [README.md](README.md).

## v2.8.2 — the decode side

- **A request may carry a zero-length body**, and 220 in the corpus do — `0x010C`
  (163x), `0x4633 EBLN_REPL_NOTIFY` (22x), `0x0951 DBCHANGE_POINT` (11x) and the
  rest of the `DBCHANGE` family. It is the natural encoding of a parameterless
  operation: the `u16` opcode is the whole message. An encoder must be willing to
  emit an ASDU of length zero and a decoder must accept it as complete rather
  than truncated.
- **The family band is structural, not descriptive.** §9.4 said the opcode's high
  byte "loosely tracks" the family. The supervisor's command factory selects a
  subclass by switching on `opcode & 0xFF00`, so the band is a real
  classification in the implementation.
- Decode confirmed as the mirror of encode: the decoder is handed `buf+2` and
  `total-2`, so the two reserved opcode bytes of v2.8.1 are established from the
  receive direction too.

## v2.8.1 — the segmentation ceiling

- **A segment is 16,384 bytes; the encoder may fill 16,382.** The two bytes held
  back at the head are the `u16` function code, written after the body is
  encoded — which is why the wire carries the opcode immediately before the body
  and why `total_length` counts it. An implementer reading a body is reading the
  encoder's `buf+2`.
- **Reassembly is a cursor against a declared total**, not a negotiation: each
  mapped segment copies `n` bytes and advances the cursor, and the last segment's
  length is `total - cursor`. The sender knows the total before it begins.
- **The ceiling is not exercised by anything captured.** No body in the corpus
  exceeds 16,382 B — largest complete 1,570 B, largest declared 12,073 B — so a
  client may size a receive buffer at 16 KB with confidence, while the on-wire
  form of a *multi-segment* exchange remains unobserved and stays `[OPEN]`.
- §4's segmentation open item goes from "not pinned" to "pinned in the encoder,
  unobserved on the wire".

## v2.8.0 — the two EQS records, decoded in full

- **`0x0989` mode schedule: eleven fields, not five.** `entry_ID`,
  `entry_enabled`, `mode`, `occurrence`, `scheduled_days`, `start_date`,
  `end_date`, `start_time`, `stop_time`, `days_spanned`, `exclusive`, and a
  trailing `state_text_id`. Validated on every captured record: both dates carry
  a weekday byte that must match their own date, both times must be real, the
  booleans must be 0/1, and the record must consume the body exactly.
- **`scheduled_days` is a bitmask**, bit 0 = Sunday. `0x3E` is Mon–Fri, `0x41` is
  Sun+Sat, `0x7E` is Mon–Sat.
- **`0x0987` zone: the lead `u16` is a count of names.** What an earlier edition
  called "the name again after a two-byte separator" is the second
  `Team_response` entry, whose own `name_space` supplies those two bytes — and
  the pair is the zone's **system name and user name**, not a duplicate.
- **The trailing `u16` on both records is a state-text-table id.** It had been
  an unexplained two-valued field through four wrong readings. It is constant
  per zone and identical across both opcodes.
- **A third point-type numbering**, and the most dangerous: a current supervisor
  product ships a dense 1..16 renumbering of the L-type mnemonics beside the
  sparse wire codes, spelled identically. Six of fifteen disagree.
- **How the `0x09xx` bank is organised** — section × transfer direction × record
  state — and why an opcode cannot be computed from a section index.

## v2.7.1 — the error table, corrected

- **26 of the 42 error names were wrong, and it was one defect.** The table was
  **shifted by one entry** against the vendor's field-panel error catalog, from
  `0x0007` through `0x0210` and again across the FLN band, so each code carried
  the name belonging to the next code up. The `_v2` suffixes the old table used
  (`already_exists_v2`, `value_out_of_range_v2`) are the tell: the duplicate
  names the shift produced were suffixed rather than investigated.
- **One consequence was behavioural, not cosmetic.** `0x0E11` was named
  `already_exists` and `p2_scanner` treated it as a **success**, so a failed FLN
  point-add was reported as having worked. `0x0E11` is *FLN invalid drop number*;
  the code that means already-exists is `0x0009`, which had been left unnamed.
- **`0x0E10`–`0x0E17` is the FLN error band** — field-level faults, not the
  record-state rejections the old table implied.
- **`not_supported` (`0x00AC`) is revision-dependent.** It also covers a function
  code that is specific to a different firmware revision, so a panel answering it
  does not prove the opcode is unimplemented.
- The table is now **generated** rather than hand-maintained, and `PROTOCOL.md`
  §7.2.2 records the correction rather than quietly replacing it.

## v2.7 — the operand, the paging model, and four decoded records

- **Opcodes carry operands.** A run of consecutive opcodes is usually one
  operation with a small parameter (filter, state, phase, bus number,
  boolean) encoded in the opcode instead of the body. 55 families covering
  146 opcodes are named by the dissector (`p2.operand`) and the scanner.
- **Range-and-resume paging** documented for every bulk read (§10.2.3), with
  the four selector encodings and the out-of-range resume sentinel.
- **Four record types decoded and dissected**: the enhanced-alarm definition
  (`0x0983`) and the three equipment-scheduling records (`0x0987`, `0x0988`,
  `0x0989`), including the ISO-numbered weekday byte the dissector uses as an
  alignment self-check.
- **The CPI tier corrected**: the wire opcode is chosen while the request is
  encoded, so no 1:1 operation↔opcode map exists; the object field at `+0x06`
  is the CPI function code, closing a standing open item.
- **Accuracy audit of `PROTOCOL.md`**: the §9.5 catalog is generated from the
  data the tools ship, every corpus figure derives from one reproducible
  census (206,050 trusted frames, 104,752 requests, 125 wire-observed
  opcodes across 85 captures), and the table of contents is complete.

## v2.6 — accuracy pass

The `0x29` / `0x2A` carrier labels are corrected: they were
named "peer maintenance" and "peer COV-subscribe," and the corpus establishes neither
function. They are now **session carrier** and **peer-session carrier (panel↔panel)**,
matching PROTOCOL.md §6.2; both carry the `EBLN_PING` (`0x4640`) identity exchange.
Error code `0x0E12` is named `record_state_rejected (unconfirmed)` — observed a handful
of times, adjacent to already-exists, precise meaning not pinned — and opcode `0x0030`
`AP2_SET_GLOBAL_DATA` is added. **Bug fix:** the error-tail read guarded on frame
length rather than on the post-slot offset, so a truncated `dir==0x05` frame could
render two header bytes as a phantom error code (observed: a 13-byte frame reporting
"ERROR 0x0105"). It now guards on the slot offset.


## v2.5 — response correlation + more body decoders

Responses carry no opcode on the
wire (only requests do) but echo their request's sequence; the dissector now keeps a
per-TCP-stream `{sequence → opcode}` map and **labels and decodes responses** — the
`CABINET_DISPLAY` firmware banner (revision / platform / build date / node-site-BLN), the
value responses (point name + engineering-units + value), and the identity exchange. New
request decoders too: the addressing family — point read/command, COV enable/disable,
trend, bulk upload (scope tag + name + suffix + commanded value) — and `ALARM_PRINT`
(`0x0508`) with its value block and three 8-byte event timestamps. Validated with zero
Lua errors across a ~530k-frame corpus.


## v2.2 — message-class model corrected from fleet captures

The message classes are
legacy/modern **pairs chosen by a panel's firmware generation, not by direction**:
data `0x33` (legacy) / `0x34` (modern); second channel `0x2E` / `0x2F` (identity +
DB-change/replication records + alarm prints); peer carriers `0x29` / `0x2A`
(panel↔panel, visible only from a panel-side mirror). Fingerprint a panel with
`CABINET_DISPLAY` (`0x010C`) and pick the dialect from its firmware. Also: COV
condition byte0/byte1 (priority/control-status) wire-confirmed; sequence is
per-(peer,channel) with gaps (not one global counter); `UPL_ALL_*` continuation is
application-layer cursoring, not a frame more-follows bit; event timestamps are 8 bytes
(`yr-1900, mo, day, day-of-week, hr, min, sec, cs`).


## v2.1 — wire-verified rebuild

Opcode names corrected to the full
set; the framing model fixed (the opcode is read only on request frames, at its true
variable offset); accurate body decoders for the common operations; per-opcode
*expected-body schema* notes; and the old UDP/10001 "multicast presence beacon"
decoder **removed** (it was a misattribution of unrelated gateway traffic — see
*Correctness notes*).
