-- p2.lua — Siemens APOGEE P2 (Protocol II) Wireshark dissector
-- Version: 2.8  (2026-08-25)  -- the two EQS records decoded in full
--
-- Changelog
--   2.8  The two EQS upload records decoded in full.
--        * 0x0989 mode schedule: eleven fields, not five. entry_enabled, mode,
--          occurrence, scheduled_days (a BITMASK, bit0=Sunday), start/end date,
--          start/stop time, days_spanned, exclusive, state_text_id. The old
--          reading landed on the dates by accident and mislabelled three fields.
--        * 0x0987 zone: the lead u16 is a COUNT OF NAMES. What was called a
--          two-byte separator is the second Team_response's own name_space --
--          and the pair is system-name + user-name, not a duplicate.
--        * The trailing u16 on both is the state-text-table id: constant per
--          zone and identical across both opcodes.
--   2.7  Error table corrected. Eight names were wrong -- three outright and a
--        five-code off-by-one -- and are replaced by the full 0x0001..0x0E17 set.
--        * 0x0E11 was "already_exists"; it is fln_invalid_drop_number. The
--          scanner had been treating it as a success, so a failed FLN point-add
--          reported as having worked.
--        * 0x0E12 was "record_state_rejected (unconfirmed)" / "invalid_point_number";
--          it is fln_device_failed. Invalid point number is 0x0E13.
--        * 0x0009 was unnamed; it is already_exists.
--        * 0x0002 was "out_of_scope"; it is invalid_operation.
--        * 0x0E10-0x0E17 is the FLN error band -- field-level faults, not
--          record-state rejections.
--        * 0x00AC "not_supported" also covers a function code specific to a
--          different firmware revision, so it does not prove an opcode is
--          unimplemented.
--   2.6  Accuracy pass against the corpus.
--        * 0x29 / 0x2A carrier labels corrected. They were named "peer maintenance"
--          and "peer COV-subscribe"; the corpus establishes neither function. They
--          are now "session carrier" and "peer-session carrier (panel<->panel)",
--          matching PROTOCOL.md 6.2. Both carry the EBLN_PING 0x4640 identity
--          exchange.
--        * Error 0x0E12 named "record_state_rejected (unconfirmed)" -- observed a
--          few times, adjacent to already-exists, precise meaning not pinned.
--          (Superseded in 2.7: it is fln_device_failed.)
--        * Opcode 0x0030 AP2_SET_GLOBAL_DATA added.
--        * BUG FIX: the error-tail read guarded on total>=2 and then read
--          tvb(total-2,2). On a truncated dir==0x05 frame whose routing slots run to
--          the end there is no tail, so that lifted two header/slot bytes and
--          rendered a phantom error code (observed: a 13-byte frame reporting
--          "ERROR 0x0105"). Now guards on off+2, matching the tree item.
--   2.5  Response correlation via sequence state. Responses (direction 0x01 success /
--        0x05 error) carry NO opcode on the wire — only the request does — but a response
--        echoes its request's sequence number. The dissector now keeps a per-TCP-stream
--        {sequence -> opcode} map (populated from direction==0x00 frames) and uses it to:
--          * label each response with the operation it answers ("response to
--            POINT_LOG_VALUE", "ERROR not_found — request was POINT_CMD_VALUE"), and
--          * dispatch a response-body decoder by the recovered opcode.
--        Response decoders added (designed against real captured bytes):
--          * CABINET_DISPLAY 0x010C -> firmware banner (rev / platform / build-date TLVs,
--            then node/site/BLN + IP/MAC via the walk) — the richest unauthenticated read.
--          * EBLN_PING 0x4640 -> eBLN_Node (node/site/BLN) via the identity decoder.
--          * Value responses (POINT_LOG_VALUE 0x0220, POINT_LOG_ALARM 0x0221, COV_ENABLE
--            0x0271, UPL_ALL_* 0x0981/0x0982, TREND_DATA_DISPLAY 0x0295): names + EU-units
--            string, and the value block (3F FF FF Fx quality sentinel + sub-type + f32)
--            where present. NOTE: in a plain analog read the f32 is not behind the quality
--            sentinel and its offset varies by point type, so it is left in the raw body
--            rather than guessed (see PROTOCOL.md 10.9 [OPEN]); UPL/sentinel-framed values
--            ARE decoded. Honest over confidently-wrong.
--        seq-state is populated only on the first pass (pinfo.visited guard); requests
--        precede their responses in capture order so the map is ready when the response is
--        seen. Unmatched responses (request not in capture) fall back to the generic walk.
--   2.4  Added wire-verified byte decoders for the most common request/push bodies, all
--        designed against real captured bytes (not metadata):
--        * Addressing family (POINT_LOG_VALUE 0x0220, POINT_LOG_ALARM 0x0221,
--          POINT_CMD_VALUE 0x0240, POINT_CMD_PRIORITY 0x0241, TREND_DATA_DISPLAY 0x0295,
--          UPL_ALL_* 0x0981/0x0982): optional scope tag (SYST/NONE/CC + command priority +
--          3F FF FF FF) then Name_search (name_space u16 + name TLV + suffix TLV + resume
--          cursor). POINT_CMD_VALUE also decodes the trailing f32 commanded value.
--        * COV subscribe (COV_ENABLE 0x0271 / COV_DISABLE 0x0273 / COV_DELETE_STUB 0x0272):
--          name_space + name TLV + suffix TLV + 2-byte trailer (00 FF enable / 00 00 disable).
--        * ALARM_PRINT 0x0508: scope tag, point name + descriptor TLVs, the value block
--          (3F FF FF Fx quality sentinel + point sub-type + f32), and the 8-byte event
--          timestamps. Timestamp helper decodes [yr-1900][mo][day][DOW 1=Mon][hr][min][sec][cs].
--        These run only on dir==0x00 (responses carry no opcode, so they are not per-opcode
--        dispatched). Anything past the known prefix falls through to the generic TLV walk,
--        so an unexpected layout degrades gracefully rather than mis-splitting.
--   2.3  COV_ANNUNCIATE (0x0274) per-point record corrected: each point is a
--        name_response = u16 name_space (00 00) + name TLV + suffix TLV, THEN the
--        f32 value + 10-byte condition block. The prior decoder consumed the first
--        point's name_space as part of the count and lacked per-point name_space
--        handling, so it stopped after the first point in a multi-point push and
--        mislabelled the empty suffix TLV (01 00 00) as a "value marker". Now decodes
--        every point in a multi-point COV and handles non-empty subpoint suffixes.
--        (EBLN_PING baseTime is a Unix-epoch wall-clock, not a tick counter; event
--        timestamps are 8 bytes incl. a day-of-week field — see PROTOCOL.md.)
--   2.2  message-class model added -- WITHDRAWN, see below
--   2.2  From multi-panel + command captures, later shown wrong:
--        * The 0x29/0x2A/0x2E/0x2F/0x33/0x34 values were read as message classes in
--          legacy/modern pairs chosen by firmware generation. They are not classes at
--          all: the field is a HEADER LENGTH, 13 + the total bytes of the four routing
--          slots, and those six values are simply what one site's node names summed to.
--          Compute it per frame. See PROTOCOL.md 6.2 (and 6.6 for the withdrawal).
--          The traffic is real and is selected by OPCODE: identity exchange, DB-change
--          and replication records, alarm prints.
--        * COV (0x0274) condition block: byte0 point_priority (0x23=OPER when commanded)
--          and byte1 control_status (0x00/02/03/04/06) now wire-confirmed.
--        * Sequence is per-(peer,channel) with gaps (not one global counter); responses
--          echo the request seq; reconnect resumes (no reset).
--        * UPL_ALL_* continuation is application-layer cursoring (cursor = last object
--          name), not a frame more-follows bit; single frames up to ~1570 B.
--        * Event timestamps are 8 bytes [yr-1900][mo][day][DOW 1=Mon][hr][min][sec][cs].
--        (Candidate future decoders, not yet shipped to avoid offset-fragility: a
--        seq-stateful CABINET_DISPLAY 0x010C banner decode on the response, and an
--        ALARM_PRINT 0x0508 record decode — both currently surface via the TLV walk.)
--   2.1  Per-opcode EXPECTED BODY SCHEMA for every defined function code, derived
--        from the AP2 ASDU type structures and shown as a "[schema: struct-derived,
--        not byte-verified]" note under the body. The actual bytes are still parsed
--        by the wire-verified bespoke decoders (COV / node roster / identity) and a
--        generic TLV/scope/value walk. The schema tells you what fields the body
--        SHOULD contain; byte-level splitting is upgraded per opcode as live captures
--        confirm it. (Field-by-field byte decode is NOT auto-generated, because the
--        struct->wire mapping is non-trivial — TLV framing, scope tags, and unproven
--        enum widths — so a generated split would be confidently wrong for most ops.)
--   2.0  Wire-verified rebuild: the full AP2_Function_Code name set; removed the
--        UDP/10001 233.89.188.1 "presence beacon" (misattribution); opcode read at
--        the variable post-slot offset and only on dir==0x00 (no phantom opcodes);
--        0x29-0x2F session-control band incl. 0x2A; COV/roster/identity decoders;
--        length-prefix reassembly + multi-PDU.
--   1.x  Original public version (behavioral opcode guesses; UDP beacon decoder).
--
-- Frame (big-endian): u32 total_len | u32 msg_type | u32 sequence | u8 direction |
--   four NUL-terminated ASCII routing slots [BLN, dst, BLN, src] |
--   (only when direction==0x00) u16 AP2 function code | body
-- Opcode is at a VARIABLE offset (after the 4 NULs) and present ONLY on dir==0x00.
-- There is NO multicast "presence beacon"; the real optional availability multicast
-- is 234.5.6.7:8 (off by default), not a discovery beacon.
