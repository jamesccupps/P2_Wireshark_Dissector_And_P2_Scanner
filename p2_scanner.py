Siemens P2 Protocol Scanner
============================
Universal scanner for Siemens PXC field panels participating in the Apogee
Ethernet variant of the P2 protocol. Discovers panels, enumerates FLN
devices, reads point values, and queries firmware/system information — all
over the P2-over-Ethernet transport (default TCP/5033).

Quick Start:
    python p2_scanner.py --pcap capture.pcapng                              # Learn BLN name
    python p2_scanner.py --discover --range 192.0.2.0/24 --network MYBLN     # Find everything
    python p2_scanner.py -n 192.0.2.50 -d DEVICE1 -p "ROOM TEMP" --network MYBLN  # Read a point

Protocol context (Siemens canonical vocabulary)
-----------------------------------------------
Siemens describes the APOGEE / Desigo system as three tiers:

  * MLN — Management Level Network (Insight / Desigo CC management
          stations on Ethernet TCP/IP). Optional Datamate Advanced (DMA).
  * BLN/ALN — Building-Level Network (legacy term) / Automation Level
          Network (current term). Field panels (PXC, PXC Modular, PXC
          Compact, MEC, MBC) AND the management station participate here
          as peer nodes. Wire format slot 1 = BLN identifier (case-
          sensitive ASCII). Siemens uses BLN and ALN interchangeably;
          firmware prompts still display "BLN".
  * FLN — Floor Level Network (TECs, UCs, VFDs). P1 over RS-485 or
          BACnet MS/TP. Not addressed by this scanner.

This scanner targets the BLN/ALN tier on the Apogee Ethernet (TCP-based)
variant. Robert Old (Siemens BT system architect, 2001) named the four
P2 variants: Pre-APOGEE (RAD-50/RS-485), APOGEE (ASCII/RS-485), APOGEE
Ethernet (this scanner's target), APOGEE BACnet. Per Siemens spec sheets
149-487 and 553-104 an Ethernet ALN is capped at 100 nodes per BLN.

A P2 EBLN is a full-mesh of long-lived TCP sessions: every peer node
listens on the configured port AND opens outbound client sockets to
every other peer (N participants → up to N(N-1) TCP sessions). PurpleSwift
documents this for their BACnetP2 gateway; Siemens 149-1006 confirms
"Traffic must be allowed at both the field panels and the computer
hosting the ALN for proper communication."

Port assignment
---------------
P2_PORT below defaults to 5033, the Siemens-documented value per the
white paper 149-1006 ("Configuring an APOGEE System on an IT
Infrastructure", June 2016). The port is CONFIGURABLE via Desigo CC's
"Our Server Port" setting; both the management station and every panel
must agree. The only Siemens-documented reason to deviate from 5033 is
a Datamate Advanced (DMA) co-installation collision. Override P2_PORT
(or use --port) on sites where the configured P2 ALN port is not 5033.

Terminology in this codebase
----------------------------
We use SCANNER_NAME and references to "supervisor" colloquially for the
Desigo CC / Insight management station. In Siemens' formal vocabulary
the management station is a peer node with an "Our Node" drop number
(1-99), not architecturally distinct from a field panel. We use
"supervisor" because operators recognize it; the BLN tier has no formal
"supervisor" in Siemens' model.

Wire format derived from protocol analysis of network captures plus
Siemens-published documents 125-3019 (APOGEE P2 ALN Field Panel User's
Manual), 149-1006 (Configuring an APOGEE System on an IT Infrastructure),
149-487 (PXC Modular for BACnet Networks spec), and 553-104 (PXC Compact
Series Owner's Manual). No reverse engineering of Siemens binaries was
performed.

        Cursor advancement strategy:
            Normally the panel returns the next point alphabetically after the
            cursor. When the cursor matches a point name that has a compound
            identity (device + subkey, e.g. "BCCW" + "DAY.NGT"), the panel
            sometimes returns the same record again because its internal index
            uses the compound key and our single-name cursor doesn't advance
            past it. Detection: if we get the same device name back, try
            incrementing the last byte of the cursor (e.g. "BCCW" → "BCCX"),
            which forces the panel to skip past the stuck entry and return
            whatever comes next alphabetically. Give up after several such
            retries to avoid infinite loops on genuinely-empty panels.

    2. Handshake each to learn node names
    3. Brute-force TEC device discovery on each node
    4. Optionally read all points on every discovered device (read_all=True)
       OR read specific points across all devices (read_points=["ROOM TEMP"])

# The panel's IdentifyBlock response (91 bytes) and SysInfoCompact
# response (281 bytes) both echo the panel's configured BLN, site code,
# and panel name in their TLV block, regardless of what the request

# character placeholder is accepted in slot 4 by the panel's bouncer,
# this reduces cold-discovery from a 3-dimensional Cartesian sweep
# (BLN × scanner × node) to a 2-dimensional sweep (BLN × node).
#
# Tradeoff: a placeholder scanner identity is treated as a new peer by
# the panel, which generates outbound callbacks at ~16s cadence to the
# requesting IP. To avoid those callbacks on subsequent probes, the
# optimized flow learns the canonical supervisor identity from the
# first successful response and uses that identity in slot 4 for all
# later probes. The panel treats a second session claiming the same
# identity as a parallel session and does not re-bind the supervisor
# IP, which suppresses the callbacks because the original supervisor
# IP remains the bound destination.

    """`0x0050` StatusQuery one-round-trip bootstrap (APOGEE_P2_SPEC.md §22.6).

    Sends a Status Query and parses the response for the panel's identity.
    The panel echoes its own BLN in slot 0 and its node name in slot 3 of
    the role-swapped routing header, plus the supervisor identity it
    expects as an LP-string in the body after the SYST scope footer.

    Far cheaper than the Cartesian attack (§22.1) — one request gives us
    BLN + panel name + supervisor name. Strict-peer-list panels reject
    this the same way they reject IdentifyBlock; in that case the caller
    falls through to Cartesian.

    Args:
        host: Panel IP.
        scanner_name: Slot 4 source identifier. Use `<SITE>DCC-SVR|5033` when
            site is known; generic forms get silent-dropped on strict sites
            but work on permissive ones.
        bln_hint: Optional slot 0 value. Empty is safest for true cold
            discovery — the panel ignores empty routing slots on this opcode
            on permissive firmware.
        panel_hint: Optional slot 1 value (destination node name). Empty
            works on permissive sites; strict sites may require a guess.
        timeout: Per-attempt timeout in seconds.

    Returns:
        {'bln': str, 'panel': str, 'supervisor': str, 'msg_type': int} on
        success; None on no-response / RST / parse-fail.

    cleanup tooling like `Fieldpanels dElete <name>` and
    `nodeNametable Remove <name>`. A refused / timed-out connect means

    or the panel is unreachable at the IP layer.

    Pure-passive: binds to UDP/47808 read-only, sends nothing, makes no
    NODE NAME TABLE writes anywhere. Works on switched networks because
    BACnet/IP broadcasts are visible to every host on the subnet (unlike
    unicast TCP traffic which the laptop can't see without a SPAN port).

    Why this works for BLN discovery: in a typical Siemens BAS deployment
    the Desigo CC supervisor speaks BACnet/IP heavily, and its device-
    object name typically encodes the site prefix (e.g. 'ACMEBAS-Server',
    'MAINBacnetGW', etc.). Third-party BACnet controllers on the same
    network often use the same prefix as their object names. The
    `_cold_infer_prefix` heuristic identifies the dominant prefix across
    all observed device names and returns it (e.g. 'ACME').

    Returns a list of inferred prefixes ordered by confidence (most-likely
    first). Empty list if no BACnet traffic or no parseable prefix
    discovered. Caller can feed the result to `_default_bln_candidate_list`
    or pass each prefix as `site_hint` to `cold_discover_minimal`.

    Args:
        duration: seconds to listen (default 15 — usually enough for a

        interface: bind address (default 0.0.0.0 = all interfaces).

    wrong-BLN frame so we cannot discover the BLN by probing. Supply

      are idempotent. Across all panels: ONE BLN-wide entry under
      RANDOM15CHARSXY (BLN replication collapses identical name+IP
      writes).

      Cleanup: telnet into any one panel and run

    """One-shot cold discovery — no arguments needed for the common case.

    Auto-detects the local subnet, port-scans it for PXCs on TCP/5033,
    sends ONE 0x0050 StatusQuery per discovered PXC with a single
    consistent scanner identity (the minimum-write primitive), then
    probes each discovered panel's telnet availability and optionally
    writes the result to site.json.

    Per-panel NODE NAME TABLE footprint: ONE entry under the
    `scanner_identity` label, mapped to this machine's IP. Because
    every probe uses the same name and the same source IP, the
    panels' BLN-wide replication mechanism collapses these into a
    single BLN-wide entry. Cleanup is one `nodeNametable Remove
    <scanner_identity>` on any panel — propagates BLN-wide within
    ~2 minutes.

    Returns the discovered site_config dict on success, None on failure.
    The dict has the standard site.json shape:
        {
            'p2_network':  '<BLN>',
            'p2_site':     '<SITE>',
            'scanner_name':'<SUPERVISOR>|5033',
            'known_nodes': {'NODE1': '192.0.2.1', ...},
            'node_telnet': {'NODE1': True, ...},
        }

    Args:
        network: CIDR to scan (e.g. '192.168.1.0/24'). None = auto-detect
            the primary local /24.
        save_to: Path to write site.json on success (atomic, preserves
            arbitrary extra keys). None = dry-run, just return the dict.
        bacnet_duration: IGNORED. Kept for API stability. The polished
            flow does not run BACnet recon — it's not needed for the
            minimum-write primitive and adds ~15 s wall-clock.
        skip_bacnet: IGNORED. Kept for API stability.
        probe_delay: Inter-probe delay during the 0x0050 phase.
        backfill_unknown_names: IGNORED. Kept for API stability.
            cold_discover_minimal only records panels that resolved
            cleanly, so there are no UNKNOWN_* placeholders to backfill.
        probe_telnet: If True, probe TCP/23 on each discovered panel
            and record reachability in the returned dict's 'node_telnet'
            key (mapping node_name -> bool). Default True.
        telnet_timeout: Per-host telnet TCP-connect timeout (seconds).
        scanner_identity: The slot-4 value used for every 0x0050 probe.
            Default 'P2SCAN-LAP|5033' — clean, identifiable label so the
            NODE NAME TABLE cleanup-target is obvious.
        verbose: Print progress to stdout.

    What this function does NOT do (intentionally):
      * BACnet recon
      * Wrong-BLN Siemens fingerprint probe
      * Cartesian dictionary attack of (BLN, scanner, node) candidates
      * Anything that would dump multiple distinct names into the
        panels' NODE NAME TABLEs

    If the 0x0050 bootstrap returns zero hits, the function returns
    None and prints a hint about supplying a BLN sniff or running
    `cold_discover_site()` directly (which has the dictionary fallback)
    if the user genuinely wants it.
